# Javascript Version

refer to README.md on main branch.

In this version of the app imagine the following:

1. we have decided to rename `username` to `userName`. How would this be accomplished?
2. Where did `user.info.bar` come from? What type of value is it? String, number, boolean? Perhaps an object?
3. How much did we really save in creating code?
4. How much is the ability to trace and understand the code helped/hindered by using javascript vs typescript?
